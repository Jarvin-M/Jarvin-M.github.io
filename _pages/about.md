I recently completed my Masters in Computing Science specialising in Data Science and System complexity at the University of Groningen. I also have a background in software engineering and experience working at a budding civic technology startup. 
I have a problem-solving and agile approach to designing and implementing reusable and maintainable data-centric solutions and as a naturally curious person, I enjoy deriving non-trivial solutions to complex business challenges.
 

On a personal level, I consider myself a world citizen with a cosmopolitan mindset. I enjoy exploring places, nature and food with friends and getting to meet new people in the process. I also inject some of my surplus creativity into audio production, video editing and content writing.
